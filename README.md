## Project Outline 


In this project, we are comparing three great cities San Francisco, New York and Austin which have burgeoning job opportunities, great art culture, excellent food and nightlife. But which city from these provides not only the great perks mentioned above but affordable housing as well. Of course, we took on this project with vested interests, everyone who lives in San Francisco justifies the insane cost of living and housing against the perks of being in a city which is the hub for job opportunities and such a diverse culture that everyone here feels welcomed. But we wanted to determine "Is it really worth living in San Francisco or is there a better city out there which provides all the perks of living in SF."

## Project Motivation - Why we chose this topic ?

Buying a home has always been a sign of growing up and living the American dream, on a more practical note, its about creating an investment that one can bank on in bad times. But the rising cost of housing in San Francisco has made it difficult for Millenials to purchase homes. The current average prices of homes in San Francisco are approximately $850,000.

With purchase prices hitting the roof, we decided to determine which city is best to live in by comparing the shining bastion of the west, 'San Francisco' against concrete jungle where dreams are made, 'New York' and the upcoming wannabe San Francisco, 'Austin'. 

Why did we decide to compare San Francisco, New York and Austin?
Some of the key features that people look while purchasing homes are covered by these 3 iconic cities and hence we decided to compare and contrast them to derive insights to support our claim. 

- SF, NY and Austin offer plethora of job opportunities ranging from Arts to Tech
- The all have great food, nightlife and theatre scene
- They embrace diversity


We wanted to determine if there is a city that will be a close match to San Francisco (no two cities can be the same), hence 
for this assignment, we have used the following datasets to derive insightful metrics for our final claim "Which city is better for buying a Home?" 

* The datasets for these cities include:
* Average Home purchase price for last 8 years
* Citywise Occupation Area and their salaries
* Citywise Per sq ft prices for Home purchase

## Audience's existing mindset

San Francisco is one of the fastest growing cities in America, with citizens flocking in from far and wide. Those who live there constantly tout its virtues to their friends in an effort to make them jealous and it is no secret that San Francisco is one of America’s most vital cultural hubs. With so much to see and do, there is very little reason not to move to “The City”, right?

## Audience Needs

Buying home is one of the most expensive purchases that an individual makes and living in a city like San Francisco does not make the decision an easy one. The audience wants a housing affordability comparitive analysis between popular cities having a similar background so that they can determine what does San Francisco bring to the plate that other cities don't or vice versa so that they can make informed choices about investing in home purchases.

******************************************************************************************************************************

## Audience Wants

San Francisco residents would ideally want to live here, but with a solution to the housing crisis. Currently, there is a huge demand to supply gap in the housing market and the prices are sky high. This wishlist is not that difficult to achieve if the government focuses on missioning more housing construction and provide tax reliefs to companies to move to lesser popular locations for a more even spread out of the population and which will also result in lower purchase prices and increased home inventory.

******************************************************************************************************************************

## Audience Fears

- Home purchase prices increasing further
- Increased competition for available homes
- Decreasing trend of home inventory

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

## Metrics

#### The goal of these metrics is to provide insights into home affordability across the selected cities

#### Why these metrics?
These metrics will allow us to compare and contrast home purchase prices across San Francisco, New York and Austin and also allow us to compare affordability of an individual based on their salaries with respect to how much sq ft of property they will be able to purchase in the aforementioned cities.

#### Metrics:
#### - Home purchase price based on absolute values for last 8 years 
This metric provides insight into the upward trend of home purchase prices 

#### - Percent Difference in home purchase price over last 8 years
This metric determines the percent increase or decrease in the home purchase prices across the 3 cities

#### - Difference of Price to Rent ratio against National Average
This metric compares the price to rent ratio for all the 3 cities against the National average.
P.S: The price to rent ratio closer to the national average indicates a buyer-friendly market

#### - Sq ft purchase capacity vs salaries based on occupational areas
This indicates the sq ft. buying capacity of individuals in particular occupational areas based on their salaries for all 3 cities

## Claim - Austin is the better city to buy a home as compared to San Francisco and New York!!

San Francisco is one of the fastest growing cities in America, with citizens flocking in from far and wide while New York is an iconic city with both dreamers and realists flocking to it and Austin is considered to be San Francisco in making. So which city should you choose to call Home?

When deciding to buy a home, there are so many factors that one has to consider such as:
- job opportunities
- average salaries
- average home purchase prices
- ones own personal buying capacity

The premise in our storyboard is simple:
- It is comparing citywise average salaries of individuals in different job profiles and their sq ft buying capacity in that particular city
- It is also comparing the home purchase price increase trend for the last 8 years, to provide an insight of what is the price growth rate in each city to determine the affordability
- To dig deep on the growth rate we are presenting the increase or decrease in percentage of the average home prices. 
- It is also comparing the price to rent ratio across the 3 cities, which provides details about how friendly is the buyer market

The information gleaned from these visualizations will enable home buyers to make a informed decision about which city would be a suitable abode for them.

## How I went about creating visualizations that support both the original claim and its rebuttal.
To Buy or Where to buy is such a huge dilemma for every potential home buyer and living in San Francisco does not make it any easier. So to decide whether San Francisco is the place to be or should one move to any other iconic or upcoming cities.

To present our take on this matter we have followed the below steps:
- Initially we started with web search for datasets on home and rental prices
- After analyzing the data we realized the scope is too broad and we decided to narrow it
- After narrowing the scope and re-analyzing the dataset we narrowed our focus to couple of parameters which would best be able to support our claim
- Then we started to create visualizations, which helped us to analyze and understand the behavior of the real estate market in these cities
- First we created the home purchase price trend chart, which helped us analyze the absolute price growth in SF, NY and Austin
- From the first visualization, we were able to determine that San Francisco behaves extremely difefrent from New York and Austin as the home value increases exponentially from the year 2012 onwards.
- Second we created Price to Rent ratio, this ratio is determined by dividing home price to rent price, which depicts the fact that if the ratio is low then it is a buyer friendly market
- Third we created a Salary to Expense ratio and mapped it against occupational areas for each city
- But we decided to discard this visualization because the salary to expense ratio had very little difference in their values across the cities
- The main reason for this was because even though people were earning more say in SF they were spending more too
- Hence this visualization was not providing an insight to clearly determine a claim
- Because this metric wasn't providing valid compare and contrast, we decided to include the city future growth rate and use this visualization as a warrant
- After revisiting the first two visualizations, in the first viz we realized that we needed to also show year on year percentage difference in the growth rate to determine the home purchase price growth rate trend compared to the past years
- In the second viz, we compared the price to rent ratio of each city against the national average to add a layer of depth on the friendliness of the buyer market
- Next we wanted to add more parameters that would help our claim shine through, so we decided to map the sq ft area of different households to the total home purchase price
- This metric helped us determine that to afford a single household in SF requires to pay more than double the value of the households in Austin and New York
- Next we decided to compare the annual salary pay against the sq ft
- This allowed us to determine the sq ft a person acan buy with the given annual salary

#### After analyzing all these metrics in the visualization on a storyboard, we came to the conclusion that "Austin is the better city to buy a home as compared to San Francisco and New York!!"

## Visualization in the making

After this I was at an impasse as to how do I use this data to not only make a claim but a fitting rebuttal to the claim. As a result I started exploring more articles on Gun killings and Gun control. This is where I realized that the Gun control argument will give me the opportunity to make two distinct claims, so I decided to not restrict my scope to just people killed in mass shooting but include a comprehensive data of people killed by gun, whether it was homicide or suicide or accidental death.

In the second iteration, I am comparing the Statewise Gun Law rank to respective Gun Death Rate rank to determine whether better rank means lower death rate rank or vice versa. Then I am comparing Statewise Gun Law Grade to respective Gun Death Rate Rank to determine whether better grade means lower death rate rank or vice versa.
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/DeceptiveDataviz-Iteration2/Dashboard1?publish=yes

In the third iteration, I am comparing Gun Law rank to respective Number of Deaths by Gun to determine whether better rank means lower death numbers or vice versa. Then I am comparing Statewise Gun Law Grade to respective Number of Deaths by Gun to determine whether better grade means lower death numbers or vice versa.

In the fourth iteration, I have created two dashboards, one that supports my original claim "Gun Control Saves Lives" and the other is the rebuttal claim "Insignificant impact of Gun control on Saving Lives". Next I am comparing and contrasting the original claim and rebuttal claim with similar visualizations for quicker grasp of the claims. In this iteration I have my claim and rebuttal at loggerheads to prove oppsite sides of the argument.
