## Project Outline 

In this project, we are comparing three great cities San Francisco, New York and Austin which have burgeoning job opportunities, great art culture, excellent food and nightlife. But which city provides value for money. Of course we took on this project with vested interests, everyone who lives in San Francisco justifies the insane cost of living against the perks of being in a city which is hub for job opportunities and such a diverse culture that everyone here feels welcomed. But we wanted to determine "Is it really worth living in San Francisco?".

## Project Motivation - Why we chose this topic ?

San Francisco is one of the fastest growing cities in America, with citizens flocking in from far and wide. Those who live there constantly tout its virtues to their friends in an effort to make them jealous and it is no secret that San Francisco is one of America’s most vital cultural hubs. With so much to see and do, there is very little reason not to move to “The City”, right?

As with any other major life decision you are going to make, there are advantages and disadvantages. Just because San Francisco ranks highly on the list of cities that a person “should” move to, this does not mean that it is the right choice. 

For this assignment, we are using couple of datasets to determine "Is it worth living in San Francisco?". These datasets include Home purchase prices, Rental prices, Transportation prices, Salaries and Job opportunities. We are comparing these datasets across three popular cities, to give us a better insight into the value for money factor on these cities.

## Audience Needs

San Francisco residents have been frustrated with the traffic situation, ever increasing rent and home purchase prices and the high cost of living. They need to understand whether this high maintainence lifestyle of living in San Francisco is justified when compared on different parameters with other equally popular cities. What does San Francisco bring to the plate that other cities don't or vice versa so that they can make informed choices about their future.

## Audience Wants

San Francisco residents would ideally want to live here, but with minimum traffic woes, a solution to the housing crisis, lower cost of living and great job opportunities. This wishlist is not that difficult to achieve if the government focuses on improving public transport, mission more housing construction, provide tax reliefs to companies to move to lesser popular locations for a more even spread out of the population and which will also result in lower rent prices.

## Audience Fears

- Traffic situation to get worse, no one likes being stuck in traffic for hours
- Home purchase prices rising higher
- Rentals getting more expensive than they currently are
- Exciting job opportunities would not be able to match up to the rising costs of living in the city
- An upward trend in the costs of living

## Metrics

#### The goal of these metrics are to provide insights into correlation between stricter gun laws and gun related deaths.

#### Why these metrics ?
To successfully be able support or refute my claim on Gun control, I felt that analysis of Gun Law grades or Ranks and their respective death rates would help shed insights on the nature of relationship between Gun Control and Death Rates.

Metrics:
- Statewise Gun Law Grade 
- Statewise Gun Death Rate Rank
- Statewise Gun Law Rank
- Statewise Number of deaths by Gun
- Gun Ownership Rate

## Original Claim - Gun Control Saves Lives :gun: :no_entry_sign: :skull:

The scale of America’s gun violence epidemic is not a surprise to anyone. 2017 brought one of the worst mass shooting in the country’s history, Las Vegas was drowned in sorrow with a mass shooting of epic proportions, with 59 people dead and 527 injured, followed by Texas church mass shooting which killed 26 people. More than 20,000 people kill themselves with a gun every year, and over one million Americans have been victims of gun violence in the past decade.

Gun violence takes a number of different forms, and so do its solutions. No one policy will stop every shooting, but what we do know is that when taken in the aggregate, strict gun laws have a significant impact on public safety. They save lives.

The premise is simple, assess every state’s gun law grades and compares those grades with the state’s most recent gun death rate. Consistently, there seems to be a powerful correlation: "States with stronger laws have fewer gun deaths per capita" while "States with weaker laws have more gun deaths". 

(Write up intercepts from: http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/)

In the "Gun Saves Lives" visualization, we can see that states with stronger law ranks or stronger law grades have a lower Gun death rate rank or number of deaths by gun.

## Rebuttal Claim - Gun Control does not have any significant impact on saving lives :gun: :skull: :no_entry_sign:

In the Rebuttal visualization, we can see that stronger law ranks or law grades do not have a significant impact on lowering the Gun death rate rank or number of deaths by gun. In the viz, we see that some states despite having a high Law Grade or Law Rank have a high number of Gun death rate rank or deaths by gun.
Also, when we compare Gun Ownership data to Gun Death Rate, we see that there is no defined trend between those two, which clearly determines that more number of guns does not necessarily mean more deaths.
Hence, the claim that Gun Control Saves lives is questionable in nature.

## How I went about creating visualizations that support both the original claim and its rebuttal.
America has been struggling with Gun Violence issue for a really long time, So when President Obama emphasized on Stricter Laws for Firearms purchase, it raised a heated debate over the country and since then there have been multiple attempts at determining whether Stricter Laws dissuade or reduce Gun Violence.

To present my take on this matter I followed the below steps:
- Initially I blindly started with web search for datasets and attempted to narrow my search only to mass shootings as they were the highlight of any media discussion
- Soon I realized that mass shooting was just a small of piece of the whole pie, and more lives were lost annually through suicides and homicides by Gun
_ So then I decided to broaden my view and instead of focusing on mass shooting I decided to start reading articles on gun killings
- Thus I stumbled on Gun Laws and Gun grades and after understanding the article and dataset I decided to pursue this train of thought
- First thing I did after was to finalize my claim "Gun Saves lives" and its rebuttal "Insignificant impact of Gun Control on saving Lives"
- Reading various articles on Gun Control and Gun Save Lives helped me understand the data better
- Then I collected datasets, a lot of them were referenced in the articles that I was reading
- Next I deep dived into data, and understood what the data was trying to represent
- Now it was time to decide the metrics that would bring forth my claims to the forefront
- After finalizing the metrics, I started cleaning the data and exploring visualizations
- First I created visualizations that would support my origin claim "Guns Saves Lives"
- Then I created visualizations that would support the rebuttal claim "Insignificant impact of Gun Control on saving Lives"
- After creating individual visualizations, I combined them based on the claim they were supporting on a dashboard
- Next, I decided to use similar graphs to present contrasting points of view for maximum impact
- For this, I compared and contrasted Gun Law Rank vs Gun Death Rank and Gun Law Rank vs Number of deaths by Gun for a take on whether stricter gun laws reduce gun violence or not
- Similarly, next I compared and contrasted Gun Law Grade vs Gun Death Rank and Gun Law Grade vs Number of deaths
- Added all the visualizations to a story and published it

## Visualization in the making

The shootings of Las Vegas and Texas were still fresh in my mind, hence all I could think of when I started developing my visualization was scouring for mass shooting data, and of course it wasn't too difficult to find the data.

In my first iteration I am comparing the data of number of people killed in mass shooting from 2015 - 2017.

After this I was at an impasse as to how do I use this data to not only make a claim but a fitting rebuttal to the claim. As a result I started exploring more articles on Gun killings and Gun control. This is where I realized that the Gun control argument will give me the opportunity to make two distinct claims, so I decided to not restrict my scope to just people killed in mass shooting but include a comprehensive data of people killed by gun, whether it was homicide or suicide or accidental death.

In the second iteration, I am comparing the Statewise Gun Law rank to respective Gun Death Rate rank to determine whether better rank means lower death rate rank or vice versa. Then I am comparing Statewise Gun Law Grade to respective Gun Death Rate Rank to determine whether better grade means lower death rate rank or vice versa.

In the third iteration, I am comparing Gun Law rank to respective Number of Deaths by Gun to determine whether better rank means lower death numbers or vice versa. Then I am comparing Statewise Gun Law Grade to respective Number of Deaths by Gun to determine whether better grade means lower death numbers or vice versa.

In the fourth iteration, I have created two dashboards, one that supports my original claim "Gun Control Saves Lives" and the other is the rebuttal claim "Insignificant impact of Gun control on Saving Lives". Next I am comparing and contrasting the original claim and rebuttal claim with similar visualizations for quicker grasp of the claims. In this iteration I have my claim and rebuttal at loggerheads to prove oppsite sides of the argument.
